Spring's web framework is based on the Model-View-Controller(MVC) architectural pattern. This architecture decouples business functionality from the presentation logic.

	* The model represents the application data
	* The view presents the data from the model
	* The controller receives user input and populates the model

Spring MVC Implementation:

	1. Controller is a Java class which receives web requests from the user, performs some business logic (usually on the service layer), and returns domain objects into the model.
	2. Model consists of JavaBean components which are produced by the controller, ready for the view.
	3. Views are usually developed using JavaServer Pages(JSP) with the Java Standard Tag Library(JSTL). The Java objects in the model can be accessed using the JSP expression language.
